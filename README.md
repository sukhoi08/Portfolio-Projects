Covid Portfolio Projects
COVID Portfolio Project involves:

Data Acquisition: Obtaining a COVID-19 dataset, from Kaggle.

Data Cleaning and Formatting: Preparing the data for analysis, using Excel.

Data Loading: Importing the cleaned data into SQL Server for efficient querying and storage.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using SQL queries to uncover initial insights and patterns within the data.

Software Used: SQL Server Management Studio

In this project, I focused on analyzing the global impact of COVID-19 vaccination. I collected vaccination data, case counts, and death rates from public databases, cleaned it for further analysis, and conducted exploratory data analysis using SQL. The main deliverables were visualizations comparing vaccination rates, case counts, and death rates across different regions, allowing for an understanding of trends and areas with low vaccination uptake or high fatality rates.

Key Contributions:

Imported and cleaned large datasets related to COVID-19 vaccination and death rates.
Used SQL to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), finding key patterns and insights from the data.
Visualized comparisons of vaccination rates, case counts, and death rates to support data-driven policy decisions.
